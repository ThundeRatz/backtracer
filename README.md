This has nothing to do with backtracing, it's just tracer's backend and API :)

[![Swagger Docs](https://validator.swagger.io/validator/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbacktracer.thunderatz.org%2Fdocs%2Fv1%2Fswagger.json)](https://backtracer.thunderatz.org/docs)

Backtracer is the backend for [Monitracer](https://github.com/ThundeRatz/Monitracer), [Tracer's](https://thunderatz.org/projects/robots/tracer) app.
It works as an API to save and retrive the robot's information, including constants, rules and testing info. This is in a **very** early stage of development.
API docs can be found on the badge above.

## Getting started

Live version is at https://backtracer.thunderatz.org/, for local development and testing:

```bash

```

App runs by default at `localhost:8000`, go to `localhost:8000/docs` to see the docs and try the API

---

## Authentication

Authentication is made via an API Key provided by the `x-api-key` header.

---

As stated, this is in very early stages, there's only a few endpoints,
this README will be updated when more features are added
